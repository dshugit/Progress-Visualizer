# Progress-Visualizer

The program requires SDL in order to display the graphs.
The program also needs a text file (.txt) to store/read the scores. The path to this file should be entered on line 8 in the quotation marks. The default is set to D:\data.txt.
Make sure to use "\\" instead of "\" for your path.
The edit data functionality has not yet been implemented.
